## 🌸 About the Game

**Braj Dham** is a culturally inspired Match-3 puzzle game that blends traditional Indian spiritual aesthetics with modern mobile gaming mechanics.

Instead of candies, players match:

- 🪔 Diya
- 🌸 Lotus
- 🦚 Peacock Feather
- 🏺 Matki

- 🐚 Shankh

The goal is to complete levels, earn stars, unlock temple upgrades, and engage in community chat.
